The model utilizes advanced data mining techniques, including the Frequent Pattern (FP) Growth algorithm, to uncover frequent itemsets and association rules within H&Mâ€™s transaction records. By analyzing these recurring purchasing behaviors, the model generates personalized, data-driven recommendations aligned with individual customer profiles, boosting satisfaction and reducing return rates.
